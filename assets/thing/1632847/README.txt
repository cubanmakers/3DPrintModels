# Summary

**This is 'Version 2' of the popular E3Dv6 Bowden X-carriage mount for Prusa i3.**
https://youtu.be/BtmDortWBnY

If you have a Prusa i3 and are upgrading your hotend to an E3Dv6 (Lite and clone compatible) with Bowden, then you'll need this hotend mount for your X-carriage.

As this design clamps the hotend to the mount, there's no chance of a wobbly hotend. 

Cooling has been incorporated into this version, rather than a bolt-on after thought.

This updated design removes the clutter around the hotend so you can view the printing unobstructed. 

A 50mm Radial/Blower fan is utilized to provide ample cooling for your prints resulting in sharp and detailed finishes.

* [50mm Blower Fan](http://www.banggood.com/3D-Printer-12V-DC-50mm-Blow-Radial-Cooling-Fan-p-980653.html?p=9X051049165582016063)
* [Genuine E3Dv6](http://amzn.to/2qDS6kV) or [E3Dv6 Clone (1.75mm long)](https://www.banggood.com/0_4mm-All-metal-3D-Printer-Extrusion-Head-Nozzle-With-Fan-p-1036420.html?p=9X051049165582016063)

3 Parts - the Mount, Clamp and Duct.
To clamp the E3D hotend, you'll need 2 x M4 screws with 20mm length and 2 x M4 nuts.
For the Duct, you'll need 2 x M3 screws with 6mm to 10mm length
For the Blower fan, you'll need 1 x M3 screw with 25mm length and 1 x M3 nut.

*Note: If your X-axis end-stop is on the right hand side, you'll lose approximately 10mm on the X-axis because the blower fan is quite long.*

**Inductive sensor option - check the remixes section :)**
Duct v1.1 added to support E3D v6 block with silicone sock.
