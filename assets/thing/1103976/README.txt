# Summary

**NOTE:** X-MOTOR.STL and X-IDLER.STL are made for 22mm spacing

**UPDATE 15.5.2016**
- moved X-stepper mount point 5mm to left for 21mm version (X-MOTOR_21mm_WIDER.STL)

**UPDATE 14.2.2016**
- made parts with 21mm spacing for Geeetech i3 pro c

**UPDATE 29.12.2015**
- I had identified wrongly the idler bearings my printer came with. They're F693ZZ, not F623ZZ. With latter GT2 belt could not move freely. I have modified the clearance of the belt tensioners arm part so that both bearings should now work.
- Updated belt tensioner arm part is added as own file for those that have printed the complete set before.

---
X-axis with fixed X-endstop and finger adjustable belt tensioner. Nothing new compared to already published (like ffleurey's <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:160636">thing:169636</a> and jkoljo's <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:372056">thing:372056</a>). It's just this smooth looking design I like and wanted to share it.

Note that there's no spesific Z-endstop trigger point as I prefer inductive proximity switch (mounted with <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1066268">the extruder</a>).

**The distance between Z-axis's smooth rod and leadscrew is not same in all Prusa i3 versions.** The kit I bought from Aliexpress.com is having 8mm acrylic frame and designed with 22mm distance but it seems that 17mm is more common. Also in Geeetech I3 X the distance is different, 27mm.
- I have made necessary modifications and now there's X-motor and X-idler for 17mm, 21mm and 27mm distance too. Please inform me if the design has any faults.
- stepper motor mounting point is moved 5mm to the left in X-MOTOR_27mm (Geeetech I3 X)

GT2 belt ends should stay in place without zip-ties. My printer is fixed in enclosed cabinet so belt removal is easier and doesn't require removal of X-carriage.

<h5>Required hardware</h5>
<pre><code>2 x F623ZZ (3x10x4) or F693ZZ (3x8x4) flanged bearing (idler)
4 x M3 20mm recessed head screw (stepper + idler)
1 x M3 nyloc nut (idler)
6 x M3 12mm hex socket screw (leadscrew nuts)
2 x M3 10-16mm hex socket screw (tensioner)
2 x M3 nut (tensioner)
1 x M4 20-30mm hex screw (tensioner)
1 x M4 nut (tensioner)
</code></pre>

# Print Settings

Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.2 - 0.25 mm layer height
Infill: 30% honeycomb

Notes: 
<b>All parts have necessary built-in supports.</b> X-idler's "comb"-supports are 0.5mm width. If slicing generates problems with these, try to change <i>default extrusion width</i> to â‰¤0.5mm.

# Post-Printing

Supports should be easily removable. X-endstop has tiny supports, that I carefully cut out with small blade.

If you find there's not enough room for smooth rod, carefully ream the holes with 8mm drill bit. Design clearance is only 0.05mm.

<b>Note that X-axis's smooth rod may not be exactly coincident with X-idler's right end when assembled. It is essential that there's no bending of Z-axis's rods when X-axis moves along it.</b> Take your time to achieve this before tensioning X-belt.

Belt tensioner block has separate guidance piece that should be glued in right place. <b>Make sure there's no binding between this piece and mating hole in X-idler's right end when assembled. Idler bearing holder should also move without binding.</b> Design clearance is 0.25mm in all sides.

<b>Before adjusting belt tension, make sure there's small gap between tensioner block and X-idler's right end to prevent bending the Z-axis's smooth rods and leadscrew.</b>
